			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Algolia API Client Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Algolia API client implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Core client structure and authentication, 2) HTTP request handling with connection pooling, 3) Retry logic and rate limiting, and 4) Endpoint-specific methods implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to networking concerns, error handling, retry logic, and connection pooling. It requires deep understanding of both HTTP client implementation and Algolia's API specifics."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Type Conversion Layer Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the type conversion layer implementation into subtasks for: 1) Basic field type mapping between WIT and Algolia formats, 2) Schema and index settings conversion, and 3) Search query and results conversion.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating bidirectional mappings between different type systems, which can be complex. It requires deep understanding of both the WIT interface types and Algolia's API data structures."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Index Management Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the index management implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Index creation and configuration, 2) Index deletion and listing functionality, and 3) Schema update and settings modification capabilities.",
			"reasoning": "This task builds on the client and conversion layers with moderate complexity. It involves implementing several related operations for index management with proper error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Document Operations Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the document operations implementation into subtasks for: 1) Single document upsert and retrieval, 2) Batch document operations (upsert and delete), and 3) Document ID generation and concurrency control.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing CRUD operations with batch processing, which adds complexity. It requires careful handling of document IDs and proper error management for various scenarios."

		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Basic Search Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the basic search implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Text query processing and execution, 2) Pagination and simple filtering implementation, and 3) Result highlighting and sorting capabilities.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing search functionality involves complex query processing and result handling. This task requires careful mapping between the search interface and Algolia's query capabilities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Advanced Search Features Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the advanced search features implementation into subtasks for: 1) Faceted search implementation, 2) Complex filtering with AND/OR operations, 3) Custom ranking and multi-attribute sorting, and 4) Advanced highlighting and attribute retrieval control.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the advanced search features that need to be implemented. It requires deep understanding of Algolia's advanced capabilities and careful mapping to the WIT interface."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Advanced Configuration and Tuning",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the advanced configuration implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Typo tolerance and language-specific settings, 2) Field boosting and relevance tuning, and 3) Synonyms, stop words, and plurals handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing complex configuration options that affect search behavior. It requires understanding of linguistic features and search relevance concepts specific to Algolia."

		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Error Handling and Resilience Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the error handling and resilience implementation into subtasks for: 1) Standardized error mapping system, 2) Retry logic and backoff strategies, 3) Connection pooling and timeout handling, and 4) Logging and troubleshooting infrastructure.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the comprehensive error handling and resilience features needed. It cuts across all other components and requires careful consideration of failure modes and recovery strategies."
