			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Common Code",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Setup Project Structure and Common Code' task into subtasks covering: 1) Project structure initialization, 2) WIT binding generation, 3) Error handling implementation, 4) Utility functions development, and 5) Test harness creation. For each subtask, include specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up the foundation for the entire project with multiple components including project structure, WIT bindings, error handling, utilities, and test infrastructure. While not the most complex technically, it's critical to get right as all other tasks depend on it."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement ElasticSearch Provider",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement ElasticSearch Provider' task into subtasks covering: 1) Client connection and authentication, 2) Index operations implementation, 3) Document operations implementation, 4) Query operations implementation, 5) Schema operations implementation, 6) Error handling and mapping, and 7) Durability integration. For each subtask, include specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing a complete search provider with multiple complex operations, query mapping, error handling, and durability integration. The ElasticSearch API is extensive and mapping it to the WIT interface will require careful design decisions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement OpenSearch Provider",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement OpenSearch Provider' task into subtasks covering: 1) Client connection and authentication, 2) Index operations implementation, 3) Document operations implementation, 4) Query operations implementation, 5) Schema operations implementation, 6) Error handling and mapping, and 7) OpenSearch-specific features. For each subtask, include specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to the ElasticSearch provider but slightly less complex as it can leverage some of the patterns established in the ElasticSearch implementation. Still requires implementing all interface functions and OpenSearch-specific features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Typesense Provider",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Typesense Provider' task into subtasks covering: 1) Client connection and authentication, 2) Index operations implementation, 3) Document operations implementation, 4) Query operations implementation, 5) Schema operations implementation, 6) Error handling and mapping, and 7) Vector search capabilities. For each subtask, include specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing the Typesense provider is complex due to its different API structure and the need to support vector search capabilities. The schema enforcement requirements add additional complexity, and there may not be a mature Rust client available."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Meilisearch Provider",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Meilisearch Provider' task into subtasks covering: 1) Client connection and authentication, 2) Index operations implementation, 3) Document operations implementation, 4) Query operations implementation, 5) Schema operations implementation, 6) Error handling and mapping, and 7) Meilisearch-specific features (faceting, typo tolerance). For each subtask, include specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Meilisearch has a different query model than ElasticSearch/OpenSearch, requiring careful mapping to the common interface. Supporting faceting, typo tolerance, and vector search adds complexity, though a Rust client is available."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Graceful Degradation Strategy",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Graceful Degradation Strategy' task into subtasks covering: 1) Capability matrix creation for all providers, 2) Unsupported feature handling implementation, 3) Stream-search fallback mechanisms, 4) Optional feature handling (facets, highlights, scores), 5) Runtime feature detection utilities, and 6) Documentation of provider limitations. For each subtask, include specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it requires deep understanding of all providers' capabilities and limitations, designing consistent fallback behaviors, and ensuring a uniform experience across different providers with varying feature sets."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Durability Integration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Durability Integration' task into subtasks covering: 1) Identifying operations requiring durability, 2) Implementing checkpointing for multi-step operations, 3) Creating resumable state for batch operations, 4) Implementing recovery logic, and 5) Optimizing checkpoint frequency. For each subtask, include specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Durability integration is highly complex as it requires careful state management, checkpointing, and recovery logic across all providers. Ensuring operations can be resumed correctly after interruptions while maintaining performance is challenging."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Developer Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Create Developer Documentation' task into subtasks covering: 1) Installation and configuration guides, 2) API reference documentation, 3) Provider-specific capabilities documentation, 4) Example patterns and usage guides, 5) Troubleshooting and optimization documentation, and 6) Architecture diagrams and visual aids. For each subtask, include specific content requirements and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive documentation requires covering multiple providers, their specific capabilities, configuration options, and usage patterns. The complexity comes from ensuring accuracy across all providers and creating clear, actionable guidance for developers."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Example Applications",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Example Applications' task into subtasks covering: 1) Basic search functionality examples, 2) Advanced search feature demonstrations, 3) Provider switching examples, and 4) Real-world use case implementations. For each subtask, include specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Creating example applications is moderately complex as it requires demonstrating various features across different providers. The examples need to be practical, educational, and showcase the benefits of the unified interface."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite' task into subtasks covering: 1) Interface compliance tests, 2) Error condition and edge case tests, 3) Performance benchmarking, 4) Durability and resumability tests, 5) CI/CD pipeline setup, and 6) Memory and resource usage validation. For each subtask, include specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive testing suite is complex due to the need to test multiple providers, various error conditions, performance characteristics, and durability features. Setting up realistic test environments for each provider adds additional complexity."
