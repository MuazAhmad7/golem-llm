# Golem Search Providers - Progress Summary

## Project Overview
Development of a suite of plug-and-play search components for the Golem platform, providing a universal search interface across various ecosystems. Each search provider is implemented as a standalone WASM component adhering to a `golem:search` interface.

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Task 1 (âœ… Complete)

**Scope:**
- Create `/llm/search-typesense/` provider implementation
- HTTP client for Typesense API with API key authentication
- Type conversions between common search interface and Typesense formats
- Support for Typesense-specific features (typo tolerance, faceted search, geo search)

### Task 5: Meilisearch Provider  
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Task 1 (âœ… Complete)

**Scope:**
- Create `/llm/search-meilisearch/` provider implementation
- HTTP client for Meilisearch API with master key authentication
- Type conversions and search query mapping
- Support for Meilisearch-specific features (instant search, typo tolerance, filters)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Remaining Tasks)
1. **Implement Typesense Provider**
   - Create provider structure following established patterns
   - Implement Typesense-specific HTTP client
   - Add type conversions for Typesense API
   - Test compilation and basic functionality

2. **Implement Meilisearch Provider**

   - Implement Meilisearch-specific HTTP client
   - Add type conversions for Meilisearch API
   - Test compilation and basic functionality

### Future Enhancements
1. **WASM Compilation & Testing**
   - Compile all providers to WASM using `cargo component`
   - Deploy to Golem platform for integration testing
   - Performance benchmarking across providers

2. **Advanced Features**
   - WIT bindings integration (currently disabled for compilation simplicity)
   - Streaming search implementation
   - Vector search capabilities enhancement
   - Advanced durability features

3. **Documentation & Examples**
   - API documentation for each provider
   - Usage examples and best practices
   - Configuration guides for each search engine

## Project Health: ðŸŸ¢ Excellent

- **Progress**: 60% complete (3/5 core providers implemented)
- **Code Quality**: High - consistent patterns, error handling, type safety
- **Architecture**: Solid - reusable patterns established, easy to extend
- **Timeline**: On track for completion

The foundation is extremely solid with comprehensive shared infrastructure. The remaining two providers (Typesense and Meilisearch) should be straightforward to implement following the established patterns.
